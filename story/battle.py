"""The Battle

You rush into battle with the second wave, arrows flying past your head and hitting orcs. You come face to face
 with a orc. Your sword srikes and skids off the side of his armour, you become unbalanced and he swings back.
 You catch his sword with your sheild and cleave him over th head he falls to the ground and withers patheticly.
 with the next volley of arrows the orcs reteat. You won!
